# Restaurant Billing System

## Abstract
This is designed especially for a restaurant which wants to attend to their customers in a very well manner. This system has the capability to take orders from the customers.

Thereby, raising employees’ potency and reducing client complaints. It depends upon the customer that what he exactly wants to purchase and what he needs at the time. This system has the capability of calculating the bill according to the total number of the item ordered which is then shown to the customer in a proper bill.

Further, we will see the designing of the system and its parameters on the basis of which our system does work properly.

## Motivation
In a restaurant keeping track of everything happening is not an easy task to undergo. Observably, you would never want your customers waiting for their bill while the staffs are creating the transaction details manually.

Restaurants rely on manual approach which results to some disadvantages such as: delayed transactions, consumed much time for calculation and inaccurate sales reports.

For the above mentioned disadvantages providing a billing system is a solution, to the problem. It provides faster and accurate manipulation that contribute to a much reliable and efficient work.

Automation is the answer to this. Automating orders, catering and reservation is a great way to stay track in food business. It provides fast, efficient and convenient manipulation and distribution of works.


## Introduction
- Overall idea about the project: 
The overall idea is to construct a program in 8086 that will provide the user a very easy to use tool in a restaurant that will fetch orders and give them the bill. It will also provide them a visual of the whole menu with the prices of the dishes respectively. This can boost up the functioning of restaurants as they wouldn’t have to take orders manually and the customers can just walk up to the machine and give their orders. This will increase the efficiency of the functioning of the restaurants.

- Background of the project:
The project is based on emu8086, it is completely implemented in assembly language. It is not heavy on the processor as it doesn’t have to go through several computational steps to finally end up in assembly language, enabling fast and easy operation.

## Overall Architecture

- Flowchart

## Methodolody/Algorithm
Step 1: Initialise data segment <br />
Step 2: Assign all the print statements to their respective variables <br />
Step 3: Input the choice of the menu from the user <br />
Step 4: Compare the choice and jump to the respective labels <br />
Step 5: Input the choice of the dishes from the user <br />
Step 6: Input the Quantity of the dish from the user <br />
Step 7: Compare the choice and jump the respective price labels <br />
Step 8: Calculate the total bill amount with respect to the quantity <br />
Step 9: Now either go back to the main menu or exit <br />
Step 10: Stop <br />

## Conclusion and Future Work
Finally, in the restaurant billing system source code, the outcome of all the time hard work is here. We have a system which takes the necessary choices of the customer according to the various filters like price, category of the food, and popularity. Then he is able to place the order accordingly and then the system calculates all the total of the order with taxes and then it can dispatch the bill that is handed over to the customer. 

Future work: 
We can  increase the amount of dishes in the menu with a wide variety of cuisines and segregate them respectively.

Our future work will include providing the users various methods for the customers to pay their bill for example card payment,UPI etc. And also provide them with their bill numbers. Add repeat orders option.
